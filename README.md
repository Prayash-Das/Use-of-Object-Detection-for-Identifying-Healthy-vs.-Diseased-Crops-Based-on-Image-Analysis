# Plant Disease Detection System

This project is an advanced plant disease detection system employing deep learning models, significantly contributing to agricultural technology by enabling early disease intervention.

## Dataset

The Plant Village dataset was utilized for its diverse collection of crop leaf images with various diseases, crucial for training the machine learning models to accurately identify and classify plant diseases.

## Models Implemented

Multiple models were implemented and fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in disease classification. These models include:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Fully Connected Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2

## Results

The system achieved high accuracy in identifying plant diseases, with CNNs reaching up to 99.61% accuracy on the test dataset. This showcases the ability to handle complex image data and feature extraction effectively.

## Collaboration and Future Work

This project highlights the potential for further research and application development in agricultural technology through collaborative efforts. There is a commitment to sustainable practices and continued innovation to improve disease detection and intervention in crops.
